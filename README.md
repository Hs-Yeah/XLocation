##Features

The process is very easy, you just need to enter an address (at least a city and its country), then the plug-in while get the coordinates corresponding to this address and generate the GPX file.

###Using a Map

You get a location from the map view.
<br />
Just need to do a `right click` on the map everywhere you want, then the plugin will get the corresponding address.

````

- City
- Country

```` objective-c
@Optional

- Address 	(Default value: `Downtown`)
- Zip Code
- The filename
